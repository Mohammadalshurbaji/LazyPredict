# Discover the Best ML Model for Your Project in Minutes!

Have you ever wondered which ML model is the most accurate and efficient for your project? It can be quite challenging at times! While scrolling recently, I came across something really interesting that can save us countless hours.

By using the **LazyPredict** method, you can easily run a simplified training test on your dataset to quickly identify the best ML model for your project! It's quick, ready to use, and will present the top models along with the most relevant metrics. A **real game-changer**, right?

I had to test it myself, so I tried it on one of the most popular datasets, **Load_Iris**, and it worked really well. **The best part?** You can use it for both **classification** and **regression tasks**!

## How It Works

1. **Load the dataset** (e.g., Iris dataset for classification or stock data for regression).
2. **Use LazyPredict** to automatically fit and evaluate multiple models.
3. **Get the results** including key metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and time taken.

## Requirements

- `LazyPredict`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `yfinance` (for stock data)
- `numpy`

## Usage

Run the provided Python scripts to quickly compare machine learning models for your dataset.
